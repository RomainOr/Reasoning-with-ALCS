# BEACS

## Installation

Python 3.x has to be installed to use BEACS. 
We suggest you to use *conda* or *miniconda*.

Then, you have to create a conda environment according to the environment file included in the repository :

` conda env create -f environment.yml `

Really **check** that the variable `PYTHONHASHSEED` has been set to `0` in your newly created environment, so that you can reproduce some results if needed.

The main libraires used within this project are listed in the `environment.yml` file.

## How to set up experiments with Ray

Currently available with :
- Maze - Bench - Beacs.ipynb

On Local Mode :
1. Open the desired jupyter-notebook that has Ray.
2. Comment or delete `ray.init(address='auto', _redis_password='5241590000000000', runtime_env=runtime_env)` if present.
3. Uncomment or write `ray.init(ignore_reinit_error=True, runtime_env=runtime_env)` if not present.
4. Start running the code of the jupyter-notebook.

On Remote Mode :
1. Start a first ssh tunnel towards your server : `ssh -L <port>:<addressip>:<port jupyter> <user>@<addressip>`
2. Launch a Jupyter server and be sure you can access it through your tunnel. Think about using `jupyter-notebook --port <port jupyter> --no-browser` or updating the config file.
3. Launch a Ray server with : `ray start --head --dashboard-host "0.0.0.0"`. Be carefull about where you start the server, otherwise you'll need to change some lines of code in the import part of the ray remote function.
4. Start a second ssh tunnel towards your ray dashbord : `ssh -L <port>:<addressip>:8265 <user>@<addressip>`. 8265 is the default dashboard ray port and can be changed if needed with *--dashboard-port* option in the previous step.
5. Open the desired jupyter-notebook that has Ray.
6. Uncomment or write `ray.init(address='auto', _redis_password='5241590000000000')` if not present. *_redis_password* can be another one and is given when the ray server is started.
7. Comment or delete `ray.init(num_cpus=NB_OF_PROCESSES, ignore_reinit_error=True)` if present.
8. Start running the code of he jupyter-notebook.
